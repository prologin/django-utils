    Add helper to get auth headers for app.
    To use add those environment variables:
    OIDC_<app-name>_OP_CONFIG: Defaults to the one in settings

    OIDC_<app-name>_RP_SCOPES: Scopes to request when authenticating to OP

    OIDC_<app-name>_RP_CLIENT_ID: Client ID of the service you're authenticating to 
    OIDC_<app-name>_M2M_USERNAME: Username to use to get an OIDC token
    OIDC_<app-name>_M2M_PASSWORD: Password associated to the username

    If calling `get_auth_headers_for_app` with `"app-name"` replace `<app-name>` with `APP_NAME`.
