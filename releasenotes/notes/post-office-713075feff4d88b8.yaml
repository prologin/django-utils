features:
  - |
    Add `post_office` to `settings.common`. Previous email settings can still
    be used. A scheduled task `send-queued-mail` has also been added to Celery
    app configuration to allow asynchronous email sending.
upgrade:
  - |
    `settings.common.DEFAULT_DOMAIN` now defaults to `app.localhost` instead
    of `localhost` to allow `post_office` to send mails from the automatically
    configured `DJANGO_DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL` (now `noreply@app.localhost`).
